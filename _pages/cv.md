Work experience
======

* Apr. - Oct. 2024: ML Research intern at [Valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io/blog/) <img src="/images/valeo_logo.png" alt="Valeo.ai" width="60" height="20" /> \
  **Supervisor**: [Spyros Gidaris](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=7atfg7EAAAAJ&hl=en), [Florent BARTOCCIONI](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=SemxkMwAAAAJ&hl=fr) \
  **Subject**: *"Tokenization from multi-camera autonomous drivin data"* \
  **Outcomes**: (Ongoing)

* Feb. - Aug. 2023: ML Research intern at [Airbus DS](https://www.airbus.com/fr/space/space-made-in-france-by-airbus) <img src="/images/Airbus.jpg" alt="Airbus" width="60" height="20" />\
  **Supervisor**: [Alexandre Mayerowitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandre-mayerowitz-393a45b7/?originalSubdomain=fr) \
  **Subject**: *"Building segmentation and polygonalization from very high resolution satellite imagery"* \
  **Outcomes**: Creation of a new architecture based on [HRNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07919) and [Attraction field Map representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.021220) which enabled us to obtain better segmentation masks, respecting the coherence constraints: segment sharing for terraced houses, polygon complexity, accuracy: 1 pixel and robustness: must work on all types of landscape.*

* July. - Sept. 2022: ML Research intern at [Qohash](https://qohash.com/about-us/) <img src="/images/Qohash.png" alt="Qohash" width="60" height="20" />\
  **Supervisor**: [Julien Keutchayan](https://dblp.org/pid/202/2872.html) \
  **Subject**: *"Insider threat detection within companies using temporal graphs"* \
  **Outcomes**: Creation of a new architecture to detect malicious activity in a company. Malicious activity can be characterised as much by a one-off action as by a series of incoherent actions. It also depends on the person's role within the company. The solution was to create a [temporal graph of activity](https://github.com/graphaware/neo4j-timetree) for each employee and then, at a higher level, to introduce a company graph. Malicious activity is then detected in a self-supervised manner using an auto-encoder. 

* Feb. - May 2021: Research assistant[M2S](https://m2slab.com/) (ENS Rennes) <img src="/images/m2s.png" alt="m2s" width="60" height="20" />\
  **Collaborator**: [Jack Prioux](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ebUlLVQAAAAJ&hl=fr), [Fabien Renouf](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabien-renouf/) \
  **Subject**: *"Workload planning for a professional women's handball team based on data from various sensors"* \
  **Outcomes**: Statistics and data visualization.

* July. - Aug. 2021: ML intern at [Wizdeo](https://www.wizdeo.com/en/about-us) <img src="/images/wizdeo.png" alt="m2s" width="60" height="20" /> \
  **Supervisor**: [Jordan Tremoureux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordantremoureux/?originalSubdomain=fr) \
  **Subject**: *"Predicting the cost of a YouTube influencer sponsorship based on key performance indicators"* \
  **Outcomes**: Data manipulation in SQL tables or Mongo databases, followed by data cleaning, visualisation and spline regression finetuning to obtain an explainable model.
