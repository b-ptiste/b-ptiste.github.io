Bio
======

I am currently an ML research at [Raidium](https://www.raidium.eu/) where I work on adapting large-scale vision–language and self-supervised foundation models to the medical domain. My current research focuses on bridging the gap between natural and medical imaging by extending self-supervised learning to CT and MRI data, with the goal of learning transferable, robust representations for clinical tasks. I am also working also contrastive reports to 3D MRI/CT volumes pre-training as a backbone for report generation.

Previously, I interned at [Valeo.ai](https://valeoai.github.io/blog/) as part of my **MVA Master's degree at ENS Paris-Saclay** in France. I studied multi-camera tokenisation methods applied to the field of autonomous cars. I am genuinely motivated by research that bridges theory and practice, bringing theoretical advances into real-world applications.
