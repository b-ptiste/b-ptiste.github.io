Molecule Retrieval with Natural Language

Objective
======

The aim of the project, as described in the document, is to address the advanced task of retrieving molecules using natural language descriptions as queries, introduced by the paper "Text2Mol: Cross-Modal Molecule Retrieval with Natural Language Queries." This challenge involves developing a method to match textual data with molecular structures from a large database effectively.
