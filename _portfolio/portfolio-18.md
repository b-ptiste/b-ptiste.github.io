*Optimal transport, Graph alignment* \

*The aim was to study the paper [Wasserstein-based Graph Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.06048) which studied the alignment of graphs of different sizes in a soft way using optimal transport methods. I re-implemented the paper from scratch as the code was not available.*\
